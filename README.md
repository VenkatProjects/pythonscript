##Python Twitter Follower Count

> You would need to replace "consumer_key", "consumer_secret", "access_token", and "access_token_secret" with your own API keys obtained from the "Twitter Developer Dashboard". 
> You can learn more about the Twitter API and how to use it in the Twitter API documentation and by exploring examples and tutorials online.

##Python Password Generator 

> This script generates a random password by selecting characters from a combination of upper and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation.
> The length of the password can be adjusted by passing a value to the length argument when calling the generate_password function. By default, it generates a password of length 8.
